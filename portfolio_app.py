st.markdown("""
My life journey has been one of creativity and continuous learning. Since childhood, I found joy in transforming paper and cardboard into toys. The thrill of creating something new has always been at my heart, driving me to explore new tools and technologies.

I started my professional journey in 2019 as a trainee in the mechanical assembly sector, but my breakthrough came in 2020 when I transitioned to production planning and control (PPC). Excel played a key role in this transition. At that time, even with basic knowledge of the tool, I started by creating charts and gradually learning more about formulas. The first time I saw a VBA program running, my mind was "blown away." This led me to learn VBA by myself, which allowed me to optimize processes and develop solutions for the company.

A few years later, Excel was no longer enough to create the projects I wanted. So, in October 2023, I began a professional data scientist course, and since then, I have been improving my coding skills, learning about Python machine learning models, and a bit of statistics.

In February 2024, I experienced another breakthrough in my career when I joined a retail sales company as a data analyst. This not only significantly improved my analytical skills but also allowed me to apply the knowledge I developed in the Data Scientist course.

What started as simple toys has grown into a career rooted in innovation and problem-solving. Whether building with paper, coding VBA, or applying machine learning with python, my passion remains the same: creating and discovering new possibilities.
